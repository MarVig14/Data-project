### Word Frequency Count Project  
**This project analyzes customer satisfaction by counting word frequency of received feedbacks.**

We counted the most frequent words to uncover issues that our customers are the most concerned or satisfied about. Each comment has its own customer rate from 1 to 5 where _1 - unsatisfactory_ and _5 - satisfactory_. This rate provides better understanding if the particular word is meant in positive or negative way.  

We found out, that customers were satisfied with **prices**, but were not satisfied with **data of product**. This helped us better understand our customers and make correct business decisions.
