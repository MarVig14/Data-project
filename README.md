# Word Frequency Count Project  
This project analyzes customer satisfaction by counting word frequency of received feedbacks.

We counted the most frequent words to uncover issues that our customers are the most concerned or satisfied about. Each comment has its own customer rate from 1 to 5 where _1 - unsatisfactory_ and _5 - satisfactory_. This rate provides better understanding if the particular word is meant in positive or negative way.  

We found out, that customers were satisfied with **prices**, but were not satisfied with **data of product**. This helped us better understand our customers and make correct decisions about prices and products.
