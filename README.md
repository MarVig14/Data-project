# Word Frequency Count project  
This project analyzes customer satisfaction by counting word frequency of received feedbacks.

We counted the most frequent words to uncover issues that our customers are the most concerned or satisfied about. Each comment has its own customer rate from 1 to 5 where 1 - unsatisfactory and 5 - satisfactory. This rate provides better understanding if the particular word is meant in positive or negative way.  

We found out, that customers were satisfied with prices, but were not satisfied with data of pausal and that helped us better understand our customers and made correct decisions about prices and products.
