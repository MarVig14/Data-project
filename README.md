### Word Frequency Count Project     
* development/word_count_project  

**Project analyzes customer satisfaction by counting word frequency of received feedbacks.**

We counted the most frequent words to uncover issues that our customers are the most concerned or satisfied about. Each comment has its own customer rate from 1 to 5 where _1 - unsatisfactory_ and _5 - satisfactory_. This rate provides better understanding if the particular word is meant in positive or negative way.  

We found out, that customers were satisfied with **prices**, but were not satisfied with **data of product**. This helped us better understand our customers and make correct business decisions.

### Soil Analysis Project
* development/Soil_analysis

**Project analyzes soil data retrieved from sensors.**

We conducted 2 different experiments on 3 sensors. In the first experiment, we measured soil continuosly, but in second we heated soil in oven for 90 minutes and then measured for another 90 minutes. Our main goal is to compare data and see, which sensor is most reliable for measurements. 

By comparison of moisture, we observed that values of **sensor003** are decreasing over time, but in the second experiment with heated soil, moisture values increased. This could be due to changing position of coil in soil or wrongly decoded data.

We found **weak correlation** between soil temperature and moisture. Soil temperature values slightly increased after heating, but actual ones increased much more.
