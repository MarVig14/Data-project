# Word Frequency Count project  
This project analyzes customer satisfaction by counting word frequency of received feedbacks.

We counted the most frequent words to uncover issues that our customers are most concerned or the most satisfied about. Each comment has its own customer rate from 1 to 5 where 1 - unsatisfactory and 5 - satisfactory. This rate helps us better understand if the particular word is meant in positive or negative way.  

We found out, that customers were satisfied with prices, but were not satisfied with data of pausal. This helped us better understand our customers and made correct decisions about prices and products.
